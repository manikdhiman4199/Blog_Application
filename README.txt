You can install the dependencies by running these commands

npm install body-parser
npm install ejs
npm install express
npm install mongo
npm install mongoose

-----

After installing all these dependencies you can run the program by running the command 

node app.js

------

All of my GET requests are inside the app.js file.
I have created a separate module to handle all the POST and PUT requests. 
That module is located inside the modules folder. The file is named as postHandler.js
